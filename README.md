# Fastlane demo files

An example of how I use fastlane in order to create a new app then submit it for review.

## Example 

You'll notice many of my fastlane files will have keys {apple_email_string, app_identifier_string}, typically I'll use a find and replace script for those keys after copying the fastlane files into a new Xcode project.
